# Robot-Arena-Money-Cheat


This is a program that gives the user 2^20 money in the game Robot Arena. This is for the PC version that came out in 2001.
The main purpose of making this program was for testing myself to find the base pointers of a program. With base pointers one can always access a specific variable in memory instead of trying to search for it everytime the program gets run. Cheat engine was used to find the pointers.

HOW TO USE
Go to the bot editing screen then run the program.
If it succeeded then the program should say "Write Success"
the game graphics however won't update until you buy or sell an item.
alternatively you can always use the built in cheat by pressing '$', however it doesn't give as mush money.
